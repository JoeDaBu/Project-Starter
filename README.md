# My Personal Project

## Alarm Clock

- My Alarm Clock will function as any other alarm clock but with added functionality.
- Like being able to play music from a playlist, and podcasts.
- Have puzzles that must be solved in order to stop the alarm.
- **Extra:** Be able to mix the volume of music I feed it, to be the same.
- Smarter optimization of setting alarms.
- I will use it on my laptop.
- Anyone watching an alarm on their computer can use it.
